Helpers for modsecurity Logs

The helpers at the moment:
- 1 additional rule that logs the anomaly score even when the request isn't intercepted
- 1 interactive script that greps and filters todays (default) logs for relevant data (feel free to set $logpath to whatever time frame is needed)

### The story ### 
 - when modsecurity is set to "on" but with a high anomaly threshold in order to NOT intercept the request (kind of like audit mode) it does not actually write the anomaly score into the log file.

   Rule 2001099 changes this.
 - when in high-threshold-audit-mode: this change is needed for the script modsec_maininfo.sh to work, as it greps for the added log content.
 - it can be quite tricky to obtain relevant information from the modsecurity logs, the interactive script can help here


### Requirements ###
 - modsecurity 2.9.2
 - CoreRuleSet 3.3.2

   tested with SecRuleEngine set to on with rule 2001099 and high threshold level

   tested with SecRuleEngine set to on with intercepted requests (works without rule 2001099)
 - if needed for high-threshold-audit-mode: Rule 2001099 that is run AFTER the rules of CoreRuleSet (defined in apache-mods/security2.conf)
 - SecAuditLogType should be set to "Concurrent" in /etc/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf

```
     SecAuditLogType Concurrent
     SecAuditLogStorageDir /var/log/modsec_audit
```

 - dialog (sudo apt install dialog)

### Tested with modsecurity 2.9.2 ###
 - CoreRuleSet 3.3.2
 - Ubuntu 20.04
 - Apache


### INSTRUCTION ###

 Clone Repository and add executable bit:
```
git clone https://github.com/stefanpinter/modsecurityhelpers.git
cd modsecurityhelpers
chmod +x modsec_maininfo.sh
```

Run this script
```
 ./modsec_maininfo.sh
```

It searches for the messages in the logs.
The messages and their number of occurence is shown.
Choose the message you want info about.

It will present you 
- the matching logfiles
- information about the request header (for example GET /drupal/setup.php)
- the PTR record of the IP of the http client (if there is one)
- the id of the matchin rule
- information about what matched

### TODO ###

  - minimise the need for grepping through the whole logs multiple times each run (by writing the results to a temporary text file)
  - better usability to configure another log path
